# Minecraft BTA Old Nostalgic bugs mod

A Babric mod for [Better Than Adventure mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/3106066-better-than-adventure-for-beta-1-7-3-timely) 1.7.6.2_02.

Brings back some old nostalgic bugs from older Minecraft versions:
1. [Minecart boosters](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Minecart_booster);
2. Boat water lifts;
3. Ladder gaps: player can climb ladders with gaps in them;
4. [Water ladders](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Water_ladder): entities can get into water/lava through corners (or signs) on west and north sides of them (also known as south-east rule).
5. Fast and infinite fire spreading from alpha Minecraft (Thanks to [Amb0s](https://github.com/Amb0s) for the solution).

Thanks to [OldDays mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275907-olddays-nbxlite-spawnhuman-ssp-sspc) ([on GitHub](https://github.com/Exalm/Minecraft-mods)) for hints.
